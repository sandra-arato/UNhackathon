		<h1>Changing the way we think about volunteers</h1>
		<section>
			<p>
				Frontliners.org aims to break the ice between the public and the 8000 UN volunteers by amplifying their presence on social media.
			</p>
			<p>
				We use the Rise platform to understand who is shaping the presence of the UN Volunteer force on social media.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether battling ebola in West Africa, supporting refugees on the Syrian border, or promoting gender equality in Equador, we believe that using social media this force of frontline philanthropists can tell its stories to and inspire a wider audience.

				Frontliners.org was originally conceived at the UNInflux Hackerthon in February 2015 by a team of coders and designers passionate about the problems UN Volunteers spend their lives battling.
