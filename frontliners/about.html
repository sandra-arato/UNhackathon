				Frontliners.org aims to break the ice between the public and the 8000 UN volunteers by amplifying their presence on social media.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether battling ebola in West Africa, supporting refugees on the Syrian border, or promoting gender equality in Equador, we believe that using social media this force of frontline philanthropists can tell its stories to and inspire a wider audience.

			<h2>How it works</h2>
			<p>
				We use the <a href="http://docs.risedotglobal.apiary.io/">Rise platform</a> to understand who is shaping the presence of the UN Volunteer force on social media. We then publish a curated and ranked list to present the most influencing volunteers to the public in an engaging way.

				<p>
					The selected volunteers get a private notification on twitter that informes them that they were shortlisted among the most influential people regarding volunteering.

					They visit a page where they can discover others with similar interests and use the list to connect to them. They can also challenge their followers or friends to donate to a specific cause, hence influencing even more lives with a push of a button.
